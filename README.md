# Horiseon-challenge (week one challenge)

## Description

As an aspiring web developer, this project has given me a small sample size working with VS code.  I have replaced the div tags with appropriate HTML semantic elements.  I have also implemented the tag names into the CSS, I have also condensed the CSS so that elements with the same attributes and properities will be grouped into the same ruleset.  

I've learned, through much trial and error, how to improve the functionality of the CSS, specificly writing CSS code to group multiple elements in the same class.
